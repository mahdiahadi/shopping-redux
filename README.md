# Shopping App with Redux and Material UI

## Description

This project is a fully responsive shopping application built with React and utilizes libraries such as Redux, Redux Toolkit, and Material UI. The app allows users to browse a list of products fetched from the fakestore API, add items to their shopping basket, and proceed to checkout. The application also features user authentication with Redux, allowing users to sign in and access their personalized shopping experience.

## Usage

1. Upon launching the application, users will see a list of products from the fakestore API.
2. Users can browse through the products, view details, and add items to their shopping basket.
3. To proceed with the checkout process, users can click on the shopping basket icon to view their selected items.
4. If the user is not authenticated, they will be prompted to sign in or create an account.
5. After signing in, the user can complete the checkout process, providing shipping and payment details.

## Features

- Add and remove items to/from the shopping basket
- Update the quantity of items in the basket
- Persist the shopping basket across page reloads
- User authentication and authorization with JWT
- Registration and account management
- Checkout process with order summary and confirmation
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices

## Technologies Used

- React
- Redux and Redux Toolkit
- Material UI
- Axios (for API requests)
- React Router (for navigation)
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
- Faker (for generating fake user data for authentication)

## API

The application fetches product data from the fakestore API (https://fakestoreapi.com/). The API provides the following endpoints:

- `/products` - Get all products
- `/products/:id` - Get a specific product by ID
- `/users/register` - User registration
- `/users/login` - User login and authentication
- `/users/profile` - Get user profile data

## Redux Store Structure

The Redux store is organized into several slices:

- `products` - Contains the list of products fetched from the API
- `basket` - Holds the user's shopping basket and manages the items added
- `user` - Manages user authentication status, profile data, and tokens
